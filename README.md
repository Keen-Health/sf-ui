# Steps to set up a local development environment
1. Clone git repository
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code IDE
3. Connect to your sandbox from Visual Studio Code and deploy your code. That’s it!
4. When you push your changes into the Git repository, it may ask for your Git credentials. To accept your credentials, you need to create Personal Access Token (PAT) from your Git account and provide it when Git prompts for password. 
    - You can create your PAT from "https://github.com/settings/tokens",
    - Goto Personal access tokens >> Token (classic) >> Generate new token (classic)
    - And use this when Git prompts for password
5. That’s it! You should be able to pull/push changes.
